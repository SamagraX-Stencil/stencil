Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! 

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
our project that we need help with including:

* Problems found during setting up a new developer environment
* Gaps in our Quickstart Guide or documentation
* Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Code Of Conduct 
If you're a first-time contributor here, you're required to go through the code of conduct elaborated [here](https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil/blob/main/sample/01-all-features/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

It is determining for you to adhere to these guidelines if you wish to become a contributor on this project. 

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

* New features
* Builds, CI/CD
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Existing issues

## Find an Issue

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [Click here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for extra information to
help you make your first contribution. 

If you want any issue to be assigned to you, you need to first create a draft PR. The issue would be assigned on that basis. 
Tag the appropriate person for getting the issue assigned. 


## Pull Request Lifecycle

Once you've found a suitable issue to work on, you can raise a PR from your forked repository. You can find the 
standard PR template here - [pull_request_template](https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks.  We recommend that you adhere to the PR template format and 
include all the checklist items. 

## Development Environment Setup

Every folder has it's own README specifiying how to set up the service. 
Just follow along the steps mentioned and you will have the service running on your local.
