Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! 

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
our project that we need help with including:

* Problems found during setting up a new developer environment
* Gaps in our Quickstart Guide or documentation
* Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

* New features
* Builds, CI/CD
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Existing issues

## Find an Issue

[Instructions](https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil/issues)

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [Click here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for extra information to
help you make your first contribution. 

Sometimes there won’t be any issues with these labels. That’s ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don’t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can ⚠️ **explain how people can ask for an issue to work on**.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" with the appropriate person tagged is good. 

## Ask for Help

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#ask-for-help)

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

⚠️ **Pick the way(s) that you prefer people ask for help**

* The original github issue
* The developer mailing list
* Our Slack channel

## Pull Request Lifecycle

Once you've found a suitable issue to work on, you can raise a PR from your forked repository. You can find the 
standard PR template here - [pull_request_template](https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks.  We recommend that you adhere to the template format and 
include all the checklist items.
