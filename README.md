# Stencil

Stencil is an opinionated backend framework based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com), built keeping Developer Experience and Developer Productivity in mind. 
Stencil aims to reduce the development setup times so that the developers writing backend services can spend more time writing business logic unique to the service rather than setting up common tooling which is shared across projects. 


## Getting started

### Usage

1. Install the stencil-cli globally on your system
```bash
npm i -g @samagra-x/stencil-cli
```

2. Bootstrap a new project using:
```bash
stencil new <PROJECT_NAME> 
```
During the setup the CLI will prompt you to select all the toolings you want by letting you pick and choose between what you want to have in your service.

### Demo

A demo video depicting how to use stencil-cli can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaafplnJMlfKgYB-WwyfINREjqoRQSLb/view?usp=sharing)

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamagraX-Stencil/stencil
```

2. Install root level dependencies
```bash
yarn 
```

3. Navigate to the required directory where you want to hack around and refer directory level READMEs to understand more about the code stored there.

## Documentation

You can refer to the technical documentation which lists all the available functionality [here](https://stencil-docs.vercel.app/)

**If you have request for a specific tool to be setup automatically, please open a issue ticket and we'll try to get it added at the earliest.**
