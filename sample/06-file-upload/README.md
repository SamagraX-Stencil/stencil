<p align="left">Stencil is an opinionated <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> framework to bootstrap efficient and scalable server-side applications <em>fast</em>. Stencil uses <a href="https://nestjs.com" target="_blank"> NestJS</a> at its core.</p>

## Description

[Stencil](https://github.com/SamagraX-stencil/stencil) framework TypeScript sample app depicting how to setup and use the `FileUploadModule` .

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Setup dependent services

This examples depends on minio as a S3 based storage engine to store the uploaded files. A `docker-compose.yml` file has been provided at the root of this project which sets up a minio instance for your use. You can start the instance by running

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Setting up the environment

```bash
$ cp env-example .env
```

## Setting up file-upload

> Manually

To manually setup the `file-upload` functionality you need to register the `FileUploadModule` module in your module which can be imported from the `@samagra-x/stencil` package.

For example: 
```typescript
// other imports 
import { FileUploadModule } from '@samagra-x/stencil';

@Module({
  imports: [FileUploadModule],
  // other configs
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> Via the [CLI](https://github.com/SamagraX-stencil/stencil-cli)

To setup `file-upload` functionality automatically via the CLI simply run the following command:
```bash
$ stencil add service-file-upload 
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e,

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## File Upload Instructions

To upload single or multiple files, follow the steps below:

### Endpoint
`POST /files/upload-files`

### Query Parameters
- **Destination**: Specifies the target directory for the uploaded files. Example: `/files/upload-files?destination=uploads`.

### Request Body
The request should include the following form-data fields:
- **file**: The file(s) to be uploaded.
- **filename**: The corresponding filename(s) for the uploaded file(s).

**Note**: Ensure that the number of files and filenames are the same and listed in the correct order.

### Example
To upload files to the `uploads` directory:
```
POST /files/upload-files?destination=uploads
```
In the form-data:
- Add the files under the field name `file`.
- Add the filenames under the field name `filename`.

## File Download Instructions

To download a file, follow the steps below:

### Endpoint
`GET /files/download/:destination`

### Parameters
- **destination**: The relative path to the file within the `uploads` directory. For example, if the file is located at `your_project/uploads/resume`.

### Example
To download a file located at `your_project/uploads/resume`:
```
GET /files/download/resume
```

**Note**: The default base directory for downloads is `/uploads`, located at the root level of your project directory (same level as the `node_modules` directory).

By following these steps, you can efficiently handle file uploads and downloads within your project.
